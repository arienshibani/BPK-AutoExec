### 2. Extract the files ‚öôÔ∏è 
Open the _archive_ and **extract** the contents of the `cfg` folder into where your CS2 installation config folder exists. 
- That would typically be `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg`

### 3. Launch your new config üöÄ
**Launch** the game and **type** in the _console_ the following command: `exec autoexec.cfg`

## Info
* If the autoexec isn't booting, perhaps try to use the launch option: `+exec autoexec.cfg`

* If you are met with ` [InputService] exec: couldn't exec '{*}cfg/autoexec.cfg'` messages in the console, double check that you extracted the `bpk`folder and the `autoexec.cfg` file into the correct folder.
* For a new desktop or operating system (e.g. Linux) make sure to put (again) in place all the files instead of letting the Steam cloud transfer them automatically.
