# BPK Autoexec for CS2

A high quality and optimized autoexec configuration file for Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) that enhances the experience with useful scripts, commands, and settings. This config is designed to provide a competitive edge while ensuring a clean and organized setup.

## Installation

1. **[Download](https://github.com/arienshibani/BPK-AutoExec/archive/master.zip)** the latest version of the config.

2. Open the _archive_ and **extract** the contents of the `cfg` folder into the following path folder: `\...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg\`

3. **Launch** the game and **type** in the _console_ the following command: `exec autoexec.cfg`
   * If the autoexec isn't booting, perhaps try to use the launch option: `+exec autoexec.cfg`
   * For a new desktop or operating system (e.g. Linux) make sure to put (again) in place all the files instead of letting the Steam cloud transfer them automatically.
